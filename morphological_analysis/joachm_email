Hi guys,

So attached is the final code for building the template ECGs.

method1: is Julien's method
method2: removing RR and taking median
method3: excluding RR, removing cycle that do not correlate with average and no phase wrapping
method4: reza's way of building the template
method5: fernando's way built on top of Reza

I re-plotted all the 50 examples with the updated code.

Let me know Fernando if anything needs to be fixed,

Best,
Joachim

PS: note that for method1, I am lowering the threshold from 0.95 down to 0.5 if there is no 10 
cycles that are 'the same' (defined by correlation coefficient). If there is no 10-cycles at 0.5 
then it will output a flat line. So we can also make this lower bound even lower or leave it as is. 
Not sure what is the best.
