The FECGSYN toolbox is a reference open-source platform for NI-FECG research, product of a collaboration between the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford (DES-OX), the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, TU Dresden (IBMT-TUD) and the Biomedical Engineering Faculty at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology (BME-IIT). The authors are:
- Joachim Behar (DES-OX,BME-IIT)
- Fernando Andreotti (DES-OX,IBMT-TUD)
- Julien Oster (DES-OX)
- Sebastian Zaunseder (IBMT-TUD) 
- Gari D. Clifford (DES-OX)

History
FECGSYN is built upon the work from McSharry et al. [1] and Sameni et al. [2] 
The original code from McSharry et al. is available in MATLAB and in 
C on PhysioNet. The code developed by Sameni et al. 
is part of the OSET toolbox, also available online in MATLAB.
