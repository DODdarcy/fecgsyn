<p>Below are useful links to other open-source toolboxes which are definetly worth taking a look at:</p>

          <td> <p><em>OSET</em> is a collection of electrophysiological data and open source software for biosignal generation, modeling, processing, and filtering, The toolbox is distributed under the GNU General Public License and may be freely used or modified under the specified terms of use. The software was written and is maintained mainly in MATLAB m-code by Reza Sameni of Shiraz University.</p>
            <p><em>OSET</em> includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> general filtering and processing tools (for preprocessing and analyzing ECG and other signals, including R-peak detection, synchronous ensemble averaging, lowpass and bandpass filtering, baseline wander (or trend) removal, and power-line noise cancellation; and nonlinear Kalman filters specifically designed for removing in-band noise from ECG/MCG recordings, or, alternatively, removing unwanted cardiac signal components from signals such as EEG, EMG, and fetal ECG)</li>
              <li> multichannel decomposition and filtering tools (based on a special class of semi-blind source separation techniques that use prior information about the desired or undesired signal and noise subspaces)</li>
              <li>multichannel synthetic biosignal and noise generators (for generating realistic multichannel biosignals, including adult and fetal ECGs) </li>
            </ul>
